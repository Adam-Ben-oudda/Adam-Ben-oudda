## 💼 Mission

I’m not here to learn how to code. I’m here to engineer systems that perform.  
At 16, I’ve trained and operated independently — building intelligent data pipelines, real-time forecasting dashboards, and automated alert systems with the architecture, clarity, and modularity of production-grade software.

This profile isn’t about experimentation — it’s about execution.

## 📈 Work Ethic

- ✅ I work 6–10 hours daily on systems architecture and development  
- ✅ I prioritize discipline over experimentation — every project has structure, intent, and follow-through  
- ✅ I write documentation and commit histories like an engineer, not a student

This is not a career I’m planning. This is the career I’m already executing.
