## 🧠 Who I Am

I’m 16 — and I’ve already decided I won’t wait for permission to build like a professional.  
I treat every project like it’s headed to production.  
Every file, every test, every line of code is written with long-term clarity in mind.

This isn’t a portfolio of side projects.  
This is an evolving **engineering track record** — built in public, under pressure, with purpose.

## 🚀 What I’m Building

### 📊 Entreprise KPI Dashboard *(In Progress — Core System)*

A full-scale, modular business intelligence dashboard built with enterprise engineering principles:

| Module                  | Status   | Highlights                                                  |
|------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `📈 Forecasting`         | ⚙️ Built   | Custom churn & revenue prediction logic (Python, pandas)     |
| `📊 Visualization`       | ⚙️ Built   | Real-time Streamlit dashboard with filters & KPI cards       |
| `📧 Alerting & Reports`  | 🛠️ Draft  | Auto email pipeline with condition-based logic               |
| `🧪 Testing`             | ⚙️ Built   | PyTest + schema validation + isolated fixtures               |
| `🐳 Deployment`          | 🛠️ Draft  | Dockerized, environment-isolated build, `.env` managed       |

🧠 Fully modular | Git-managed | CI-ready structure
