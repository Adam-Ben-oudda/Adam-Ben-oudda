🚀 Adam Ben oudda — Data Science & AI Specialist Portfolio
🧠 About Me

I’m Adam Ben oudda, a highly driven and accomplished Data Scientist & AI Specialist with a proven track record of building enterprise-grade forecasting systems and neural architectures for time series data — all under tight timelines and high performance expectations.

In the past few months alone, I’ve completed and deployed multiple advanced data science projects within 7 hours each, showcasing not only technical mastery but also strategic thinking, project acceleration, and business impact.

I specialize in building clean, modular, production-ready systems that combine classical statistical models, modern machine learning techniques, and deep learning — all with explainability, deployment readiness, and business context in mind.

My expertise is backed by 13+ industry-recognized certifications, intensive hands-on bootcamps, and deep project experience, making me fully prepared to take on complex freelance and enterprise-level AI challenges.
